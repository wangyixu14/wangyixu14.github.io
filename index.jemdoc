Hi, welcome to my page!

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/ ECE department] at [https://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University], supervised by [http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/ Prof. Qi Zhu]. My research interest falls in the learning-enabled cyber-physical systems(LE-CPSs) where the learning components act as the functionalities for perception, planning, decision-making and control. I am also interested in formal method where the safety, robustness and correctness of LE-CPSs are considered.

Prior to Northwestern, I received my B.S. from [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University].

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Guangqian Letters on Beauty, 谈美] is my favorite book talking about a systematic view of aesthetics. After you finish reading this book,
I believe you will find some aesthetic pleasure in the ordinary life which is often ignored. Walk slowly, and appreciate the life.
