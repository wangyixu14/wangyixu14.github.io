Hi, welcome to my personal page! 

I received my Ph.D. degree in the [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/ Computer Engineering] at 
[https://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University] in June 2024, supervised by [http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/ Prof. Qi Zhu]. 
I also work closely with [https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/  Prof. Chao Huang] from Unversity of Southampton, UK.  
My research interestes include machine learning and formal methods, with the consideration of safety, stability, robustness and correctness for cyber-physical systems. My Ph.D. thesis is "Safety-Assured Autonomy for Learning-Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems". 

Prior to Northwestern, I received my B.E. from [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University] in 2018.
