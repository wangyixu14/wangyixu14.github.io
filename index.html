Hi, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Northwestern University and I am honored to be supervised by Prof. Qi Zhu at Computer Engineering. 

My research interest falls in the learning-enabled cyber-physical systems(LE-CPSs) where the learning components act the functionalities for
perception, planning, decision-making and control. I am also interested in formal method where the safety, robustness and correctness of LE-CPSs
are taken into account.
